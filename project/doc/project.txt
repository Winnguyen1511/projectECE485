1) Design L1 cache:
    + Instruction cache
    + Data cache
2) Specification:
    a) Instruction cache:
        - 2-way associative.
        - 16K sets.
        - 64-byte lines.


    b) Data cache:
        - 4-way associative.
        - 16K sets.
        - 64-byte lines.
        
        -write allocate, write back
        except for the first write to line is write-through.

    LRU policy, backed by a shared L2 cache, inclusive cache.


3) Project output:
    a) Log activity:
        - Number of cache reads.
        - Number of cache write.
        - Number of cache hit.
        - Number of cache misses.
        - cache hit ratio.
    b) Communicate with L2 cache:
        - Write to L2 <address>:
            write back a modified line to L2 upon eviction from the L1 cache.
        - Read from L2 <address>:
            obtain data from L2 on L1 cache miss.
        - Read for Ownership from L2 <address>:
            obtain data from L2 on an L1 cache write miss.
    c) Modes:
        - mode 1: Displays stat and responses to 9s in the trace file.
        - mode 2: Displays stat and commnicate messages.
4) Trace:
    <n> <address>
    0: read data to data cache
    1: write data to data cache
    2: instruction fetch (read instruction cache)
    3: evict command from L2(for L2 eviction and inclusivity)
    8: clear cache, reset all state (and stat), continue to read trace file.
    9: print contents and state of cache (continue reading trace, dont clear cache).
